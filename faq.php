<h1 class="h1style">FAQ’s</h1>

<div class="container">
<p class="para1">

<p class="para3">1. Where can I learn about travel advisories?</p>
Official information, advisories and warnings are available to Canadians through the Government of Canada website at http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories. Should you be travelling to a destination with a travel warning, it may void your travel insurance. So it’s imperative that you refer to this website prior to finalizing travel plans.

<p class="para3">2.How can I book a flight, hotel or tour with Merit Travel</p>
One of our Travel Consultants will be happy to help you. Complete our online e-quote form and someone will email you or call you within 24 hours. Alternatively, you can call our toll-free number or visit us in-store at one of our locations across Canada

<p class="para3">3. What is the best way to learn about latest travel offers?</p>
Our regular email newsletter is the most effective way to learn about our current deals and travel promotions. To sign up for the e-newsletter and get timely information on vacation deals, hotels, tours, and events, click here. You can also stay current on our offers and promotions by following Merit Travel on Facebook and Twitter.

<p class="para3">4. Will I have to pay for my vacation in full when I book?</p>
These policies can vary depending on the type of trip you are planning. Please check with your travel consultant regarding your vacation, as policies vary by cruise lines, airlines and tour operators. Your travel consultant can inform you of the specific policy for your vacation.

<p class="para3">5. What personal documentation will I require?</p> 
For any international travel you will need to provide your Travel Consultant with your passport information and the exact spelling of your name, as written on your passport.
Please ensure your passport is valid for the country you are travelling to. Some countries require that your passport is valid six to eight months after you return from travelling. Visas may also be required. It is your responsibility to obtain these prior to your departure but your Travel Consultant can help you identify what you need.

<p class="para3">6. Am I protected if a tour I’ve booked has increased in price?</p> 
This doesn’t happen very often but, Merit Travel reserves the right to increase tour prices in the event of an increase in government and airport authority imposed taxes and fees, fuel and currency surcharges, supplier price increases, or any other cost increase. If the increase is greater than 7% of the tour cost, you may cancel the booking within seven days of notification and obtain a full refund.

<p class="para3">7. Do you have a cancellation policy?</p>
While Merit Travel will do its utmost to minimize any penalties charged, there may be irrecoverable costs associated with your tour. The following penalties are a guideline for some of the costs with cancellation:

(A) 90 days or more prior to departure: Loss of total deposit.
(B) 89 – 45 days prior to departure: Loss of 50% of total tour cost.
(C) 44 days or less prior to departure: Loss of 100% of total tour cost.
Cancellation penalties vary by supplier or operator and there may be additional penalties associated with the airfare. If so, these policies will be noted separately at time of booking and will prevail. Please check with your travel consultant for the specific cancellation policies for your tour. We always encourage travellers to purchase travellers’ insurance that includes trip cancellation to attempt to minimize any loss should you need to cancel your trip.

<p class="para3">8. What is the policy for refunds?</p> 
The nature of travel involves risks and unpredictable weather and so we cannot assure any departure or arrival times at any point of an itinerary. Your right to receive a refund is limited. Please check with your travel consultant for the specific cancellation policies for your vacation.

<p class="para3">9. Do I need travel insurance or am I covered with my provincial health plan?</p>
Trip cancellation and interruption insurance, medical and hospital insurance, baggage insurance, and various additional insurances are available and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Your provincial health plan will not cover you for certain health services if you are travelling outside of your province. If you choose not to purchase insurance, you are required to sign an Insurance Waiver Form. Note that if you choose not to purchase insurance, you are fully liable for any and all penalties imposed as stated under Cancellation Policy on this page. We encourage you to speak to your Travel Consultant at the time of making reservations about insurance.
